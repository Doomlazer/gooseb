ARE YOU READY FOR THE ULTIMATE 
CHALLENGE? 


It’s a whole new way to GIVE YOURSELF 
GOOSEBUMPS. There’s only one way out! If you 
don’t make all the right moves — in the right or- 
der — you'll never see the light of day again. 

Here’s the deal: You went on a class trip to 
the Hall of Science. When the rest of the class 
left, you stayed behind to finish a video game. 
Bad idea. Because now an evil Super Computer 
doesn’t want you to leave — ever! 

You’re in deep trouble. The hall is full of dan- 
gers. Like a deadly Mirror Maze. A giant, thirsty 
mosquito. And a flock of model dinosaurs with 
very sharp teeth! 

And remember, there’s only one way out. Make 
one mistake — and you're history. 


NOW, GET READY TO TAKE THE ULTI- 
MATE CHALLENGE!

GAME OVER! 

“No!” You slam your fist on the table as the 
words scroll across the computer screen. You lost 
again! 

But you’re getting better. I almost made it to 
level five that time, you congratulate yourself. 

This class trip to the Hall of Incredible Science 
is much better than being in school. You figured a 
museum would be boring. But the hall is full of all 
kinds of gadgets, nature displays, and other cool 
stuff. The best part is the Thinking Machines 
Room. It’s got incredible video games — including 
one based on your favorite movie of all time, Oper- 
ation Buzzard. 

They just announced that it’s time for the bus to 
take you back to school. Most of your class has al- 
ready headed downstairs. But you can’t resist 
playing one more game. 

You punch the START button. You hear the open- 
ing notes. A jungle scene appears in front of you. 

Suddenly the screen goes blank. 

Huh? Did the computer crash? 

Then a message appears on the screen. 

“Help me! The Super Computer has taken 
over!” 

“What?” you mutter. Is one of the other kids 
from your class playing some kind of joke on you? 

You glance around. There’s no one else in the 
room. 

Oh, well. You have to go anyway. 

You leave the room and step into the open ele- 
vator. 

But when the doors slide shut, it doesn’t move. 

You punch the buttons. You punch the buttons 
again. 

Nothing happens. 

You’re trapped! 

Don’t panic, you tell yourself. You grab the 
emergency phone. “Hello? Hello?” you shout into 
the receiver. 

A strange, deep voice answers. “You have 
learned my secret. Now you cannot leave the Hall 
of Incredible Science alive!” 

“What secret?” you gasp. “Who are you?” 

“T am the Super Computer,” the voice declares. 
“T have taken over this entire building. But since 
you got that message, you know too much. Now 
you must be destroyed!” 

“Wait!” you plead. “I thought that message was 
just a joke. I won’t tell anyone. I promise!” 

The voice just laughs. 

Then the elevator jolts into motion. 

You have a feeling you won’t like where it’s tak- 
ing you.

INSTRUCTIONS — 


You are so doomed. 

You’re trapped in the Hall of Incredible Sci- 
ence. An evil computer has taken over, and you 
know its secret. Now it wants to silence you — 
forever. 

The hall is filled with dangers. Every exhibit 
has been turned into a deadly menace. Even the 
building itself is out to get you! 

There’s only one way to get out of the building. 
To find it, you'll have to make all the right choices. 
Make a single mistake — and you'll never see the 
light of day again! 

Let’s face it. You probably won’t last five min- 
utes. 

But just to make it interesting, turn the page 
for a few tips. If you read them carefully, you 
might just survive long enough to amuse the Su- 
per Computer before you’re destroyed. 

Of course, you might make it even madder.... 



LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED 


The hall is full of deadly puzzles that you'll have 
to solve. Explore every room of the hall carefully. 
Remembering what you’ve seen will help you put 
the pieces together. 

You may want to keep track of where you’ve 
gone. Each floor of the hall has a map that you 
should try to find. The maps have clues to help you 
figure out how to escape that floor. 

You may also get some help from the “friend” 
who sent you the message. But your mystery pal 
is no match for the Super Computer. 


INVENTORY 


As you play, you’ll have the opportunity to pick 
up useful gadgets, weapons, and other objects. 
When you pick up.an object, write it down on the 
inventory list on page x. 

But decide carefully before adding an object to 
your list. Remember, not everything in the Hall of 
Incredible Science is safe to play with! An object 
might be useful in one situation, but in another, it 
could lead to a sticky end. And some objects will 
just get you in trouble, no matter what you do 
with them. 

Remember, too, that you may need certain ob- 
jects in order to get other objects. This means you 
might have to explore a room more than once in 
order to get what you need. 


FOLLOW THE NUMBERS 


There are 238 numbered sections in the book. 
Begin with # 1. Then choose where to go next. 
Follow the directions at the end of each section. 
You will usually have several choices about what 
to do. 


DO YOU FEEL LUCKY? 


You'll also need a pair of dice. Sometimes, fight- 
ing a battle or doing something tricky will require 
that you roll a certain number. For example, an in- 
struction might read: 


Will you make it across the elevator shaft? 
Roll to find out. 

If you roll 8 or higher, go to # 32. 

Tf you roll 7 or lower, go to # 164. 


Roll the two dice. If they add up to 8 or higher, 
go to # 32. If they add up to 7 or lower, go to # 164. 


That’s all the advice you get. Not that it’ll help. 
Oh, just one more thing: Don’t forget to GIVE 
YOURSELF GOOSEBUMPS! 


INVENTORYLIST


Write down on this page all the gadgets and ob- 
jects you collect. Erase them or cross them out if 
you lose them.

"The elevator finally stops on the top floor of the 
Hall of Incredible Science. The doors slide open. 
You step out and immediately the doors whiz shut 
behind you. You gaze around. 

There’s no one here. The whole hall must be 
empty by now. But the back of your neck prickles. 
You can feel an evil presence watching you. 

How are you going to escape? 


Try the elevator again? Turn to # 131. 
Try to find a telephone? Turn to # 89. 
",
	"2":
"Noise bomb in one hand, you fling open the 
doors. 

The Visible Man bursts through. You throw the 
noise bomb. 

KABOOOOM! 

You clutch your ears in pain. You can’t hear a 
thing! 

As you dash for the door, you hope the Visible 
Man is too startled to stop you. 

But you feel his slimy grip on your throat. 

Guess the surprise is on you! 


GAME OVER 
",
	"3":
"You dash back toward the dinosaur. 

It plants itself in your path, rearing back in a 
silent roar. You decide to slide between its legs. 

You shoot across the marble floor of the mu- 
seum. The skeleton searches the floor behind you. 
It’s not very smart! 

With a few more steps, you reach the doors and 
bolt into the safety of the stairwell. 

You made it! 


Turn to # 212. 
",
	"4":
"You head south and stumble out of the Maze of 
Mirrors. 

This is the way you came in! 

It takes a while for the dizziness to go away. All 
those reflecting images — so confusing! 

From here, you can leave the Waves and Motion . 
Room and head back into the main part of this floor. 
Either that, or brave the maze again. 


Leave the Waves and Motion Room? Turn to 
# 194. 
If you want to enter the Maze of Mirrors, check 
to see if you have the compass. 
The maze again, with the compass? Turn to #138. 
The maze again, with no compass? Turn to #75. 
",
	"5":
"You stretch your arm into the depths of the ma- 
chine. 

Got it! 

As you pull the little computer out, it pings in 
your hand. Is it thanking you? 

You free your hand and turn off the electric mo- 
tor. These old calculators sure made a racket! 

The tiny computer has a screen about four 
inches across. You stare intently at it. 

Your jaw drops as you read what’s printed 
there. 


Turn to # 105. 
",
	"6":
"You decide to head west. 
You count thirty paces, then the hall turns 
north. 
You walk another thirty paces that way, then 
~~-reach a junction. 
You can go east or further north. — 
Which way do you want to go? 


East? Turn to # 230. 
North? Turn to # 100. 
",
	"7":
"But as you dash past the Visible Man, his hand 
darts out. He grabs your wrist. The warm, slith- 
ery feeling of exposed muscles and veins makes 
you shudder. 

He grips your other wrist. You’re helpless in his 
slimy clutches. 

Then he gazes at you with his lidless eyes and 
croaks out two words from his visible voice box: 


“GAME OVER!”
",
	"8":
"You try to squash the ants, smacking yourself 
all over. But more and more of them swarm on 
you. 

You can’t stand it. You jump to your feet to run 
away. 

But as you stand, you feel dizzy. As if you were 
about to faint. Just as you black out, you spot an- 
other sign below the fire ants’ destroyed case: 

HANDLE WITH CARE. POISONOUS! 

Guess you couldn’t have ant-icipated that! 


GAME OVER 
",
	"9":
"You level the laser and fire at one of the tiny 
monsters. 

But the red beam just bounces off the solar 
panel on the little dinosaur’s head. The beast 
starts moving faster! 

You realize that you’ve made a bad mistake. 
These dinos are solar-powered. They eat light for 
breakfast! 

Their gnashing teeth crackle with energy. 

“Yikes!” you shout. You turn to run. 


Turn to # 137. 
",
	"10":
"You grasp the controls. Your hands are slick 
with sweat. 

The runway comes up to meet you. You’re going 
to make it! 

But then the Super Computer laughs. “Forgot 
about your landing gear, didn’t you? Ha, ha, ha!” 

Landing gear? 

A screaming metal sound echoes through the 
cockpit. It’s as if the bottom of your plane is tear- 
ing open on the runway. 

But this isn’t real, is it? 

Maybe not. But try telling that to the crew that 
has to scrape you off the runway! 


GAME OVER 
",
	"11":
"“Good work!” Peedee A. responds. “You’re get- 
ting closer to me. But you'll need an electric motor 
to help me. Over and out.” 

You step carefully over the motionless dinosaurs 
and glance around the room. Everything is lit by 
the shaky lightning of the Tesla coil. It’s spooky. 

You have a feeling you'll find the electric motor 
here. But where should you look? Should you 
check out the Tesla coil or the electric toys? 


The Tesla coil? Turn to #191. 
The electric toys? Turn to # 74. 
Leave the Electricity Room? Turn to # 13. 
",
	"12":
"You steer back toward the runway. The airport 
appears in front of you. This looks so real, you think. 

“Fire in Number Four engine,” the voice an- 
nounces. 

The simulator shakes harder and harder. BONK! 
Ouch! That was your head hitting the ceiling. 
You’re tossed around violently. 

You’ve got to keep from crashing! 

But what do you know about flying a plane? 


Can you land the plane? Roll to find out. 
If you roll 7 or higher, go to # 10. 
If you roll 6 or lower, go to # 174.

"You're about to leave the Electricity Room 
when you notice something different about it. 

It’s not as dark as it was. 

The giant lightbulb is slowly coming back on! 

You realize that the switch must just turn it off 
for a few moments, to let it cool down.... 

The little dinosaurs are starting to come back to 
life! 
Oh, no. Run for it! 


Can you make it to the door? Roll to find out. 


If you roll 9 or higher, go to # 116. 
Tf you roll 8 or lower, go to # 197.

But when you're done, the extinguisher has had 
no effect! 
Except that the snake is madder than ever. 


What should you try now? Take a look at your 
inventory list and choose a weapon. 


The space glove? Turn to # 144. 

A stink bomb? Turn to # 111. 

A noise bomb? Turn to # 198.

"The PDA told you the Crash Code might be on 
the abacus. With the code, you can turn off the Su- 
per Computer — permanently! 

The abacus looks like this: 

	|*****||****************|
	|{}---||{}{}--------{}{}|
	|{}---||--------{}{}{}{}|
	|---{}||{}{}--------{}{}|
	|***********************|


The sign under it explains that the bottom row 
represents ones, the middle row tens, and the top 
row hundreds. 

The number of beads slid toward the right indi- 
cates each numeral in the number. The lone beads 
to the left of the black bar are worth five times as 
much as the beads to the right, if they’re slid over 
to the bar. 

There are two beads slid to the right on the top 
row. The lone bead on the left isn’t slid over to the 
bar. “That must mean the Crash Code is two- 
hundred-and-something,” you mutter. “I think.” 

Too bad math isn’t your best subject. 

Can you read the rest of the abacus? If you can, 
write down the Crash Code. You'll need it later.

But how are you going to attach yourself? You 
spot an exhibit on parachutes. The parachute in

in good shape.

the model helicopters.

In seconds, you’ve strapped yourself in. You 
push a button on the jet pack. You just hope it’s 
the right one.

glints in the jet pack’s fiery exhaust. But you lift 
off, out of its reach.

models of the big dinosaur downstairs.

antenna, with lightning bolts rising up between 
the two rods every few seconds. Something a mad 
scientist might have. The label underneath it says 
TESLA COIL.
