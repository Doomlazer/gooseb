"The sun beats down on you as you wipe the sweat
from your brow.

\"Gosh... it sure is hot, George.\"

\"It's the humidity that gets you\". you tell Lennie.

You take the piece of straw from your mouth and care-
lessly toss it into the Salinas river.

You've been on the road for the last three days.
Three days since you were run out of Weed because
Lenn... well, sometimes Lennie just doesn't know 
his own strength.

Now you're hoping to find work on an artichoke farm
you were told about. It will only be temporary until 
you and Lennie can save up enough money to by that 
plot of farmland from an elderly couple you know.

\"George, Tell it like me you done before.\", stammers
your slow-witted friend, Lennie.

You've been his surrogate older brother for as long as you
can remember. You keep him out of trouble. He certainly
has a penchant for getting into trouble. Some days are worse
then others.

\"Tell you what?\", you reply.

\"about the rabbits.\"

If you tell Lennie about the farm again, turn to page # 16
If you decide to look for work, turn to page # 80

Knowing full well that Aunt Clara had to stop giving 
Lennie mice because they died from petting them too hard and 
having just been run out of Weed for assaulting a woman, 
you think it's a smart idea to promise Lennie a dog.

	"16":"
\"You really get a kick out of it, don't you? OK.\"

The fire crackles as you briefly pause before repeating
your well-worn tale.

\"Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys
in the world. They got no family. They don’t belong no place.
With us it ain’t like that. We got a future. We got somebody 
to talk to that gives a damn about us. We don’t have to sit 
in no bar room blowin’ in our jack jus’ because we got no
place else to go. If them other guys gets in jail they can
rot for all anybody gives a damn. But not us.\"

Lennie broke in. “But not us! An’ why? Because… because I got
you to look after me, and you got me to look after you, and 
that’s why.”

Throwing away the mouse sends Lennie in to an uncontrollable
rage. You've never seen such a look of pure hatred before;
especially from usually kind-hearted Lennie.

\"That was mine George! You've done a bad thing.\"

Lennie brings one of his basket ball sized fists down on your
skull. You drop to you knees, fighting to remain conscious.

\"Bad, bad, bad... It was my mouse\"

This time Lennie raises both fists above his head. You
futilely try to block the attack with your forearms, but
Lennie crushes your head like a watermelon at a Ghalager
comedy show.

GAME OVER

You notice Lennie fidgeting with something in his coat pocket.

\"Now, what you got there, Lennie.\"

\"I don't have anything. I never done nothing.\", protests
Lennie.

\"Come on now. Give it here.\"

Lennie's been keeping a dead mouse in his pocket. a patch
of fur on it's back has been rubbed away and the mouse's
neck apears to be broken. You throw the rotting mouse into
the woods.

Roll the two dice.

If they add up to 8 or higher, go to # 41.
If they add up to 7 or lower, go to # 25. 
",
	"41":"
Lennie bursts into tears and begins blubbering about the
dead mouse. You'd almost feel sorry for the guy if it 
hadn't been actively decomposing.

\"Now, I wasn't taking it away for meanness. That mouse
wasn't fresh, Lennie. Tell you what I'll do. First chance
I get, I'll get ya a puppy. That'd be better than mice.
You can pet em harder.\"

If you really believe giving Lennie a puppy is a good
idea, turn to page # 6.
If you were only saying it to stop the crying, turn to 
page # 55.
