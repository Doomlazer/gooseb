"The sun beats down on you as you wipe the sweat
from your brow.

\"Gosh... it sure is hot, George.\"

\"It's the humidity that gets you\". you tell Lennie.

You take the piece of straw from your mouth and care-
lessly toss it into the Salinas river.

You've been on the road for the last three days.
Three days since you were run out of Weed because
Lenn... well, sometimes Lennie just doesn't know 
his own strength.

Now you're hoping to find work on an artichoke farm
you were told about. It will only be temporary until 
you and Lennie can save up enough money to by that 
ten-acre plot of farmland from an elderly couple you 
know.

\"George, Tell it like me you done before.\", stammers
your slow-witted friend, Lennie.

You've been his surrogate older brother for as long as you
can remember. You keep him out of trouble. He certainly
has a penchant for getting into trouble. Some days are worse
then others.

\"Tell you what?\", you reply.

\"about the rabbits.\"

If you tell Lennie about the farm again, turn to page # 16
If you decide to look for work, turn to page # 80

\"You really get a kick out of it, don't you? OK.\"

The fire crackles as you briefly pause before repeating
your well-worn tale.

\"Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys
in the world. They got no family. They don’t belong no place.
With us it ain’t like that. We got a future. We got somebody
to talk to that gives a damn about us. We don’t have to sit
in no bar room blowin’ in our jack jus’ because we got no
place else to go. If them other guys gets in jail they can
rot for all anybody gives a damn. But not us.

Lennie broke in. “But not us! An’ why? Because… because I got
you to look after me, and you got me to look after you, and 
that’s why.”
